# PL-SQL-Collections-Records-and-GOTO-statements
This PL/SQL script simulates a Budget Enforcement System. It processes a list of personal expenses sequentially. As soon as the cumulative total exceeds a predefined limit ($100), the system triggers an emergency exit using a GOTO statement, simulating a "circuit breaker" logic that prevents further processing.
